#### Scaling Solutions on Ethereum
##### Objective
To review and explain the different scaling solutions in existence and in development.
##### Description
During the course of the lectures we will review and explain the different types of scaling solutions, their benefits and drawbacks. In the second part of the course we will deploy our own sidechain.
##### Intended Audience
In general, the course can be visited by anyone. The second part is highly technical. During that part the participants can chose to observe and learn, or actively participate in the deployment and then in the testing of the deployed sidechain.
